The Problem

Complete the function printList that accepts a node * (the head of a linked list) as a parameter and print out the list in the following format:

Node 0: 100
Node 1: 200
Node 2: 300

If the list is empty then the function should print "Empty list".

You should complete the main function to test your printList in, at least, the following cases:

    An empty list
    A list with exactly one node
    A list with more than one node (eg: 100 -> 200 -> 300, as shown above)
